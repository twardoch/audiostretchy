"""
The _stretch library implements a time-stretching algorithm for audio signals. This algorithm modifies the length of the audio signal without changing its pitch. The code works by splitting the audio into small chunks or periods and then either repeating or removing some of these periods to alter the overall length of the audio. The original code works as follows.

1. The stretch_init function initializes a "stretching context" which contains all of the necessary information for the time stretching operation. This includes the audio data itself, the desired shortest and longest periods, the number of audio channels, and certain flags for adjusting the algorithm's behavior.

2. The stretch_samples function performs the actual time stretching. It works by iterating through the audio data, finding the best period to adjust based on the desired ratio, and then either repeating or removing that period to adjust the overall length of the audio.

3. The find_period and find_period_fast functions are used to find the best period in the audio data to adjust. They do this by calculating a correlation value for each possible period and then returning the period with the highest correlation. The correlation value is calculated based on the sum of the absolute differences of each corresponding pair of samples in the period.

4. The merge_blocks function is used to combine two audio periods into one. This is used when the algorithm needs to repeat a period to extend the length of the audio.

5. The stretch_flush function is used to output any remaining audio data after the time stretching operation is complete. This is necessary because the algorithm works by buffering a certain amount of audio data and then processing it in chunks.

6. Finally, the stretch_deinit function is used to free up any memory that was allocated during the time stretching operation.

This is a sophisticated algorithm for audio time stretching that is capable of producing high-quality results.

Below are ctypes bindings to the library.
